        Hello, my name is Joelvis Cabrera and I'm looking to minor in CS. I've always had an interest in computers but never tried to learn coding until now. My computer is my main hobby as I like to play games amongst other stuff. I like being outdoors and going on hikes aswell. I have a cat named Enzo and he's a silly goofball and sometimes wonder if he has a brain at all.
